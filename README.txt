How to run the code:

Note - Please run each learner(.py) file separately. There are certain library imports
and utilities used specifically for some learners that will output errors in others if 
used together. 


- .py files - compile and run (ensure all libraries are imported and code in .py files is not altered at all)


- Ideally, we would like you to run the code in a jupyter notebook or Google Colaboratory.    You can upload either run import the .py file and test them using jupyter notebook or you can upload them  onto drive, open them with Colaboratory, and then run each file there. Since Colab and notebook come with built in resources in cloud, it will be easier to get all visualizations and model summaries for all 3 learners.
